# SODA2 Interface for [Koop](https://github.com/koopjs/koop)
This plugin makes it possible to interact with Koop's [many providers](https://github.com/koopjs/koopjs.github.io/blob/master/docs/providers.md)
using a [SODA2 API](http://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries.html).

**Note:** This plugin only works when used with these versions of [koop](https://github.com/timwis/koop) and [koop-ckan](https://github.com/timwis/koop-ckan). They've been submitted as pull requests, so this plugin is more of a proof of concept until they're merged.

# Installation
```bash
npm install koop-soda
```

# Registering the plugin
To use this plugin in your koop instance, register it the same way you'd register providers as demonstrated in
[koop's documentation](https://github.com/koopjs/koop#registering-providers)

```javascript
koop.register(soda);
```

# Usage
Append `/soda` to your normal query to interact with the resource with an OData API, for instance:

`http://localhost:1337/ckan/phl/heart-healthy-screening-sites/soda?$where=ZIP_CODE%20=%2019146`

will produce an SODA2 JSON object like:

```javascript
